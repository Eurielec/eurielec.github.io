### The beginning of a new adventure

Hello world! EURIELEC/EESTEC LC MADRID here! We just opened this blog to tell you all about our new and super exciting project! We're developing for RedPitaya!

...

-What the heck is RedPitaya?-You may ask.-Do you mean the fruit?-You may wonder.
Absolutely not! RedPitaya is an exciting, brand new Open-Source hardware device, much like the Raspberry Pi but with a completely different purpose: to become a multi-purpose, programmable hardware device for all your lab measurements, signal generation and various hardware&signal analysis and processing.
