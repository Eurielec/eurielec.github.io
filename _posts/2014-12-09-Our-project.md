## What is RedPitaya?

RedPitaya is an open-source measurment and control tool which already replaces many laboratory instruments and has the potential to replace many more.

## What is your project?

Our team is developing an AM/FM modulator for RedPitaya, a real signal (audio for example) comes through the analog input and then through the GUI you select the carrier frequency and you visualize how the signal is modulated.

## Why are you doing it?

*	It's fun!
*	It's a fantastic tool for learning how modulations work
*	We'll generate **real** modulated signals which can be transmitted like the ones you listen to on the radio!
