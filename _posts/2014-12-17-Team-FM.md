## Hey Pitayers!
Today we're going to let you know what Team FM has been up to over the past couple of weeks.
Team FM is captained by *Jorge DÃ­ez de la Fuente* (aka Jorge i7), and you can see the team **working hard** on this photo:

I actually have no clue what we were doing, but I'll tell you that recently we've been pulling some hard working sessions with MATLAB and a ton of coffee to figure out how to do this Frequency Modulation thing in real time.

## The task
FM team is in charge of the development of a frequency-modulation system for audio signals.

Frequency Modulation is an angular modulation, that is, it generates a signal centered around a RF carrier wave, where it's frequency deviation depends on the original baseband signal.

See? The frequency of the generated signal is higher or lower depending on the modulating signal.

First, we have developed a script that modulates in PM (Phase Modulation), just because of it's less complicated than FM (Frecuency Modulation) and it's closely related to the type of modulation we want to achieve (it's also an angular modulation). Once we had this script, we have adapted it to FM. Thereby, when we introduce an audio signal in the Red Pitaya, we get the same signal but modulated in FM (just like the music station you listen to on your car).

## The problems

Our main problems at the moment are performance related. This is because in order to achieve FM modulation, we must integrate the modulating signal in real-time, which presents a computational challenge that our board must perform pretty quickly if we want this modulator to be useful in a real life situation.

So far we've improved the performance of our algorithm **a thousand times!** but it's still not enough, we'll keep pushing!

## Future work

We'll publish soon a post detailing the algorithm we're using and explain the code so you guys can learn with us and maybe even help us with our problems!

Until then...*keep Pitayeing*
